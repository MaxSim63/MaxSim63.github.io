            <p> 
            Hello, my name is Maxim Simonov and I am a student at Algonuin College. My 19<sup>th</sup> birthday has yet to pass, but I aspire to be rich by 20. 
            My personal definition of <em>rich</em> is financial freedom and to live life to the fullest stress free.
            My parents both came from Belarus thus making me 100% Belarusian although I was born in Canada. I have no siblings, but
            I have a black cat named Nox. The name translates from the Latin word <em>"night".</em> 
            </p>

            <br>
    
            <p2>
            Some things I enjoy doing in my free time are, playing video games with friends, hanging out with friends, driving,
            watching content (informative or non-informative), and as of recently, only occasionally working out. After High School prom
            and Canada day, my workout routine has gone heavily downhill <abbr title=Laugh Out Loud>LOL</abbr>. Slowly getting back into it but it's more difficult now
            with College. 
            </p2>
