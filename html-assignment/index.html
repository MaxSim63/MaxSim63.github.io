        <p>Hello, my name is Maxim Simonov and I am a student at Algonuin College. I am 18 years old and aspire to be successful
            in life. At Algonquin College, I am studying in the Interactive Media Design program. In this program we go through 
            four main courses: Photography, Digital Graphics, Web Development, and Design foundations. At first, this was not a 
            program I intended on taking as a potential career path, but rather as a cruthch for other things I would like to pursue. 
            After the first couple of weeks in this program, I have already began second guessing myself and I am now considering persuing
            Media Design. </p>

        <br>
    
        <p2>Some things I enjoy doing in my free time are, playing video games with friends, hanging out with friends, driving,
            watching content (informative or non-informative), and as of recently, only occasionally working out. After High School prom
            and Canada day, my workout routine has gone heavily downhill lol. Slowly getting back into it but it's more difficult now
            with College.
